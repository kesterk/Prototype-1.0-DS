These total returns are stated before the inclusion of VCT tax reliefs,,,
which are designed to mitigate the higher risks and costs associated,,,
with investing in smaller companies and the constraints of the VCT,,,
legislation. The tax reliefs given at the time of subscription have varied,,,
between 20% and 40% so any adjusted performance measure including,,,
this relief will vary depending on the date of subscription. There is the,,,
additional benefit of receiving VCT dividends tax free.,,,
